Cisco DCNM REST API Client Sample Code

License, Examples and Project Templates to enable Cisco resources to produce and share Cisco Sample Code

Cisco Sample Code License

This license is free, enables our customers and partners to do everything they need to do with the code, but also provides Cisco the limitations and protections we need in order to keep the policy and process requirements for sample code sharing as lightweight and streamlined as possible.

License: For all Sample Code postings*, you must include a copy of the Cisco Sample Code License in a LICENSE text file in the root of the repository.

Header: You must include the Cisco copyright and license notice HEADER in every source code file (see the examples folder for language specific examples of how this should be done).

Note: For single-file code sharing (like a GitHub GIST, e-mail, blog, message or post), including the header in the source code is sufficient (you do not have to include the full license text).

Sample Module:
Tested with Python3.6.4

manageLanSwitch.py:   sample code to change device management state

discoverLanSwitch.py: sample code to discover ethernet switch 

Docs

We have also provided examples for some common project docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, etc.).

Project Templates

Coming Soon: We are working to provide some project-stem templates (like audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage) using the new Cisco Sample Code License and the cookiecutter tool.
